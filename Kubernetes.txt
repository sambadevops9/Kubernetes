Kubernetes are two types
1.self managed (it is implemented by scratch)
2.Cloud managed (most of the things given by cloud platform)

AKS--Azore Kubernetes Service
EKS--Amazon Kubernetes service
GKS--Google Kubernetes Service

What is Kubernetes used for?
---------------------------
>>Kubernetes keeps track of your container applications that are deployed into the cloud.
>>It restarts stoped(orphaned) containers, shuts down containers when they’re not being used, and automatically provisions resources like memory, storage, and CPU when necessary.

How does Kubernetes work with Docker?
------------------------------------
>>Actually, Kubernetes supports several base container engines, and Docker is just one of them.
>>The two technologies work great together, since Docker containers are an efficient way to distribute packaged applications, and Kubernetes is designed to coordinate and schedule those applications.

Kubernetes:(It is also known as K8S)
----------
>>It is addon of docker.
>>open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
>>It is managing conatinors.

Cluster:
-------
>>A cluster is all of the  components put together as a single unit.

Control plane:

Pods:
----
>> It is nothing but group of containers.
>> Inside posd having containers.
>> Pods have a single IP address that is applied to every container within the pod.

Control plane:
-------------
Api server:
---------
>>The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it.

Scheduler:
--------
>>The scheduler is responsible for assigning work to the various nodes.
>>It keeps watch over the resource capacity and ensures that a worker node’s performance.

Controller manager:
------------------
>>The controller-manager is responsible for making sure that the shared state of the cluster is operating as expected.Eg:(If a node goes down).


Worker node components:

Kubelet:
-------
>>A Kubelet tracks the state of a pod to ensure that all the containers are running.
>>It provides a heartbeat message every few seconds to the control plane.
>>If a replication controller does not receive that message, the node is marked as unhealthy.

Kube proxy:
----------
>>Kube proxy is network proxy thats run on each node in your cluster.implementing the part of git Kubernetes.
>>The Kube proxy routes traffic coming into a node from the service. It forwards requests for work to the correct containers.

etcd:
----
>>etcd is a distributed key-value store that Kubernetes uses to share information about the overall state of a cluster.
>>nodes can refer to the global configuration data stored there to set themselves up whenever they are regenerated.
